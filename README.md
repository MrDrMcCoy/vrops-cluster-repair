# This project has been removed for safety

The original script that lived here existed to help reset a malfunctioning vRealize Operations Manager Cluster and restore cluster services. However, its creator left VMware and has not had time or access to a vROps cluster to keep it updated for new versions. As such, the script is unsafe for recent versions and should not be used. Please contact VMware support if you have a malfunctioning vRealize Operations system.
